# Heath's Guide to Having a Baby and also not Developing a Drinking Problem

## Intro

As I'm writing this, Christian is about 4 and a half months old. That's about as much as this will cover. One thing that's super important to consider is that there's a good chance that literally none of this will apply to you. This thing you are bringing into the world is designed by billions of years of evolution to manipulate your emotions and your attention. Keep this in mind, because you can't take anything personally.

*"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face."* - Mike Tyson

## Pre-birth

I will not be the last one to say it, but these are basically the last free months of your 20's lifestyle. You should be winding down all the shit you have to do, your commitments and stuff. Sleep in. Go and see a movie. Enjoy silence. We took this time to rearrange the apartment, one thing per day. But seriously, do not feel guilty about doing stupid zone-out stuff.

If there is one thing babies do, it is rob you of time. If you are a busy busy busy person, you need to seriously gameplan for how you are going to deal with something that, for a very serious amount of time, needs around the clock attention. More importantly this should be a very relaxing time. You should be seeking to eliminate stress from the mother's life as much as possible. Cortisol, the stress hormone, is useful in small doses, but it can be extremely disruptive, especially to the embryo.

But don't stress about being stressed either. My larger point is that you probably have a list of things you need to do to get your shit together. Now is a really really good time to get that sorted out. Your life to this point has been a rehearsal, now it is the performance.

### Useful stuff

I personally didn't do too much reading about the process of giving birth. I relied on the team of midwives and doctors. That having been said here are some useful resources:

  * "How much coffee is okay?" "UUUUUUGH I had a glass of wine, how guilty should I feel?" "So, like, can I eat deli meat?" All fair questions and it is extremely hard to know what to believe. Veronica got a lot of comfort out of [Expecting Better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158576-expecting-better). The long and short of it is that an economist wanted the answers to these questions, so she went through the literature and summarized it.
  * Hypnobirthing. Sounds like mumbo jumbo, but giving birth is an exercise in the mind-body connection. Veronica swears by this and, having listened to it, I do to. [The Calm Birth School](https://www.thecalmbirthschool.com/) and its associated materials are fantastic.

## Birth

Yeah this was easily the most intense series of moments in my life. Yeah you should have a plan to get to the hospital, fast probably. Also, for the Dad, you should have a plan for getting back home. I would have been in no condition to drive. So you may want to like plan on an Uber or something like that. Remember to pack a car seat, btw.

### Helping Hands

We made the devil's bargain, and I could not have been happier. Veronica's mother all but lived with us (she was like 20 minutes away and would stay over when we needed it) and it was fantastic. It meant real food and clean clothes and basically someone to pick up a shift. What I'm saying is call in favors (and get specific favors) because you will have no time or energy for anything.

For the birth itself it was nice having a third person as well, if you can manage it. Like, I went and changed my clothes after sleeping on the floor.

### Dad's Job

Really my job was to make sure Veronica had what she needed. In her case this was something warm in her lower back, with pressure. And then to kind of make sure she had a cool compress after contractions. 

I don't know how strong your stomach is. I watched Christian come out of Veronica and I will never forget it until the day I die (in a good way). On the other hand, my Mom's cousin passed out and split his head open. He had to be rushed TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL as his son lay screaming in his mother's arms. Have a good honest look at where you stand on that spectrum and plan accordingly. 

Also your job is to flag nurses down if the mom-to-be needs anything.

### Boredom

A long labor can be boring, make sure you have like a podcast to listen to or something. 

## Post-Birth

Congratulations! I hope everything went well! Now the real fun begins!

I divide the time after birth into 3 pretty distinct parts:

Squoze out -> Milk comes in -> 6ish weeks

### Squoze out -> Milk comes in

You should try to spend this entire time in the hospital. The stuff that comes out of your boobies at first is not milk, it is a sugar-watery substance called colostrum. After 3-4 days, then you start producing milk. Christian did fantastic with colostrum, they said that he had 'textbook latching'. However once the milk came in, he didn't/couldn't eat enough. It would have been nice to be in the hospital for this.

Also, a lot of people are sentimental about keeping their newborn with them as much as possible during this time. The time immediately after birth (1-3 hours), yeah definitely hang out, get that skin on skin time. But you are going to be insanely exhausted, both of you. In order to take care of the baby, you have to take care of yourself. Don't feel bad about giving it up to the nursery, if there is such a thing. Get some sleep, your body has been through an insane trauma. I could barely form coherent sentences when the process was complete. "I need sleep" is now a valid excuse.

**Note** that, health of the mother-wise, you are not quite out of the woods yet. You will still be leaking blood and there are many things that can go wrong. I can't speak to the recovery time if you get a C-section, but you need to rehabilitate.

#### Poops

Your child's first couple poops will not actually be poop. They will be a substance called mecunium. Mecunium is fucking disgusting, it is like black tar. I never actually had to see it, thank goodness. Just be prepared for that.

#### Is this normal?

Newborns are not like babies you're used to. They're really weird. Like boys can come out lactating. Girls can come out menstruating. The newborn, over the course of 24 hours or so, makes a transition from being one of the mom's organs to its own independent being, metabolically and physiologically. Hormones play a really big role in this. My point is to trust the professionals. Also your baby will be covered in slippery goop and a great deal of blood. 

There's a pretty good chance that your kid's head will be malformed. This will settle out after a couple of days.

Christian had a pretty rough birth, he was crammed in there tight. So he was pretty grumpy for the first couple days. I had two opportunities to have skin on skin contact with him and it was absolute heaven. What I'm saying is pack your softest shirts.

### Final thoughts

Look you are a different person now. Having a child has a profound effect on both parents, but clearly the mom. You may not know it or feel it. Here's an article about 'Mommy Brain', but I think the lessons are applicable to fathers as well: https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/science-of-brain-after-giving-birth.html

Note that just about every new parent wakes up during the night and is like 'oh fuck where's my baby'. It still happens to me every night. Just be prepared for shit like that.

##  Milk comes in -> 6 weeks

You've probably heard it a billion times, but treating this period in time as the 'fourth trimester' was a pretty good mental shift for me. "You can't spoil him enough" is what every book says, and I agree. But I should warn you, this time can be relentlessly awful.

![](/mnt/949EF0089EEFE0AA/Users/angry/Dropbox/Photos/newborn_sleep.jpg)

The picture above as one man's plot of his newborn's awakedness. Y axis is hours of the day; X axis is days from birth. Black things are times that the baby was awake. Pretty cool. See how the first part is absolute noise and then it kind of turns into something normal? That is the 6 weeks after birth. There's really no good way to deal with it. You know how the baby is just kicking around inside of you all the time? Well that doesn't change after he comes out for a while.

### Sleep (for you)

If you have someone helping out who you trust to not murder your baby, they need to pick up some shifts for you. Someone who can take the baby from, say, 7-10 AM or something like that or from 10 - 1 AM. 

We made sure to have 2-3 changing stations throughout the house. Christian would scream SO LOUD while getting changed, but even under non-screaming circumstances, you should probably have a place to change your baby that is not in the same room as someone sleeping.

I should point out that for me, the feeling of sleep deprivation became a different sensation for me. Normally if I'm tired, I'm just sleepy all day. But during this time, I would get to ~9:30-10:00 and I would realize that I was barely able to stand. Like, I was turning a lid on a jar the wrong direction. 

#### Napping

I don't know how good of nappers you guys are, I was never very good at it, and I've gotten worse. But I found that this website: https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/fall-asleep-fast/ along with pink noise in earphones helped a lot.

### Food

Try to keep a schedule. It will be impossible, but still, [food is one of the things you use to set your circadian rhythm](https://foodandnutrition.org/blogs/stone-soup/right-foods-right-time-circadian-rhythms-nutrition/). Veronica cooked a bunch of shit up earlier, and we're still using it. But this is definitely where you should call in favors. One of our friends brought us enchiladas and I wanted to die I was so happy. Were I in the US I would have cooked up a giant Stauffers Lasagna. 

Again, this is something a grandparent or helper should be doing.

You are going to be tempted to just eat garbage, and I feel you. But if someone is cooking for you, try to get them to make you a salad or something like that. You guys are healthy, you're fine. 

### Food for him or her

Expect issues here. I have yet to run into a parent whose child was 100% a good eater right from the getgo. It definitely gets better with time. This is why you should stay in the hospital until your milk comes in. The hospital will have a lactation consultant, probably. This is a resource you should absolutely use. It's easy to get into a really bad feedback loop with a baby. **If you are having problems consult a lactation, uh, consultant**.

That having been said, both of us found this website: [Kellymom](https://kellymom.com/) to be an extremely good resource for breastfeeding shit.

#### Nipple confusion

For some reason, for a long time people were like 'don't give newborns a pacifier because they'll think that's a bottle and they'll give up'. This is just not real, give your baby a pacifier if he or she needs it. This is like the one thing babies can do, tell what things are based on how they feel in their mouths. In fact, they may be too good at it.

#### Babies are lazy

What can happen, and this is what life was like with Christian, is that you have to supplement with a bottle, either formula or pumped milk. It is way easier to drink out of a bottle than a titty. So what happens is that he'll realize that as soon as he has difficulty with the nipple, someone swoops in and gives him the bottle, which basically just dumps milk into his gullet. And then they can just shorten the time on the nerp, in favor of the bottle.

Here are two things I found useful in that regard:

https://www.bfar.org/bottlefeeding.pdf

https://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/feeding-tools/bottle-feeding/

There was a ~3 week period where basically all that Veronica did was sit there and feed Christian and also watch TV. She was about to lose her damn mind.

Oh on that note, Veronica had a hand pump thing that she would strap to her other boob while Christian was latched to the other one. She would gather an extraordinary amount of milk in that thing, that would have otherwise sprayed all over our mattress or couch. 

As Veronica mentioned, Dr. Brown's bottles with **slow flow** nipples is what we use. No matter what brand, you want the slow flow nipples.

#### Dad work

WRT feeding, yeah you bring the baby and all that. And often do burping. He will probably poop at this point as well. But every time the baby is feeding on Mom you need to bring her a big cup of water and a cell phone/entertainment device. That is your duty.

#### Burping

So we learned this awesome method of burping in the hospital:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6boVy5aF4kg

Note, that we didn't cradle his head like that, I put my hands under his armpits and used my massive hands to support his feeble neck, like so:

https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPDUuHE55wK4rkNFbIX7uQ5plMUihKzyA7ZYflSP4O6cP7bw8IBKF02UMYBBlIVSA/photo/AF1QipNn6zPI6-DlDe-pdz87qeMDuYgw2ueq5DB7qT-h?key=dWdUNHFtRWtjbmtmMDRQeTNDdEs4eDQ4R0dwaTFR

^ it is astounding how well this works by the way. It doesn't work forever, around 5-6 weeks we had to do the normal, throw him over the shoulder and pat his back until he barfs everywhere method. 

This was my absolute favorite time to spend with Christian for the first couple of weeks, for what it's worth.

#### Jesus god my baby is barfing everywhere

Talk to your doctor about Mycolin. That shit is awesome.

Also make sure that you're feeding him upright.

Your baby could also just have a derpy esophogus, so it just kind of can't hold shit down. It will grow out of this. But he or she may have some sort of like acid reflux. Sorry.

Don't hold your baby over your computer or really any electronics, btw.

#### Nipples, yours

If you are going to breastfeed, you should really have everything set to care for them. I won't go into details, but it involves lanolin creams, cold packs and warm packs.

There's a very good chance your nipples will bleed. There's a good chance it will happen while you are feeding. This means your baby will drink your blood and then will barf it up. So don't be scared if your baby vomits blood.

### Sleep

During this stage your baby should be sleeping a lot. Like, if they're awake for more than an hour, they need to sleep asap. Let the baby fall asleep in your arms or wherever. Let them sleep as much as they want. Our midwife suggested to make sure it sleeps in a diversity of places so it gets away-game practice. 

There's not much you can do here to 'sleep train', except that I would really avoid letting him or her fall asleep while feeding. These should be two separate processes. Are you ready? Babies do not know how to fall asleep! So fucked up. So you have to help them learn how to do it. Really at this stage they are just a bunch of stimulus-responses and the food-sleep one, I have heard, is insanely difficult to break.

So. Feed. Burp. Sleep. That is one thing I like about the hula-methed for burping, it's hard for them to sleep through it. Sometimes they do and its hilarious.

#### Swaddling

Not all babies take to swaddling. And we thought Christian was this way. He would scream if you tried to move his arms. But then the midwife came and swaddled him and stuffed a pacifier in his mouth and put him on his side and he shut the fuck up. It was amazing.

Now it is part of our sleep (nap and bed) routine.

It also takes some practice. Babies have hellspawn goblin strength and will bust through any weakness in the swaddle. I would recommend the [dudu method](https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/wicworks/Sharing_Center/Chickasaw/dudu.pdf) for younger babies and then just a regular swaddle as they grow up.

After a swaddle, we put him in a woombie or a woombie-like device and this does the trick.

#### Shushing

I used to hate it when people shushed babies. "They don't understand it what it means!" But then someone pointed out that shushing is white noise. Shushing + swaddle + rocking has a good chance of taking care of 90% of your babies screaming.

#### Okay but little Ainsley is still crying

Well it could be a wonderweek, check that. 

Second, it could easily be gas. For the first couple months Christian was super sensitive to beans and eggplant and maybe caffeine. So one thing we did is make some fennel infusion and gave it to him after feedings, and then made some formula with it.

Third, try gripe water. This is kind of only for emergencies when he/she just won't stop crying. It is bananas how well it works when needed. Gripe water used to be grain alcohol, lmao. But now it's just a bunch of herbs and baking soda.

Fourth, it could be colic. Very sorry if this is the case.

##### Oh he's just exercising his lungs

No. Newborns cry for a reason. Luckily there are a limited set of reasons. Food -> Tired -> Gas -> Uncomfortable. It's one of those. A lot of babies get comfort from going outside.

### Changing diapers

Another thing we learned in the hospital was the kinaesthetic method for changing diapers. And it's really influenced how I handle babies in general. The idea is that you should really be trying to mimic the movements of the baby in utero. So they like to twist around and stuff. Here's a video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XT4mDDEFeE

Notice how instead of grabbing him by his feet and lifting his butt off of the ground, she instead uses his hips to move him to the side? That's kind of the fundamental of it.

Secondly, you should always be in contact with the baby, either with a physical touch or with your voice.

Thirdly, I guess this is firstly, but when you put the baby down, you should let his butt make contact first and then lower the rest of his body. I have found this to be a very useful concept for baby-handling.

### Final thoughts on this period in time

#### Learn the hip hinge

This is something everyone should do, but you need to start keeping your back straight when you bend over. The way this is done by instead of bending at the knees, you stick your butt back. Seriously, this is a life skill that every person on this stupid planet should have. Here are two tutorials: one is npr being smug and multicultural the other is some weirdo:

http://www.nick-e.com/hinge/

^ no joke if you take one damn thing from this treatise, then this is it



## 6 weeks -> 6 months

Okay things are smoothing out now. Your baby is making eye contact with you and smiling. His or her facial features are slightly more developed and there seems to be some rhythm to the day. 

### Sleep

The good news is that your baby understands that there's a day and night. The bad news is that he just doesn't fall asleep on his own anymore. The issue of sleep training is a super contentious one, there are a bunch of methods. I happened to run across [The Happy Sleeper](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Sleeper-Science-Backed-Helping-Sleep-Newborn/dp/0399166025) on the street and it has been VERY helpful. I read it in an afternoon. But the long and short of it is that you incrementally help the baby get to sleep on their own by doing less and less for them. You may disagree with the methods, but I think the fundamentals and the reasoning are very correct.

At the very least, this is something to discuss and research, your plan for getting your baby to sleep. I would really have a plan in place. You must be consistent. My personal rule, in easing him to falling asleep on his own, was change one thing at a time. So we were at this cabin and Christian HATED the room he was sleeping in because it was stuffy. Which sucked. But he loved being outside, that would calm him down. But to put him to sleep we had to change two things: being outside and being in arms. And it kind of sucked. BUT it got better.

Note that the happy sleeper method is really only going to work if your guy or gal is a good go-er to sleeper already. I've read accounts of some people whose kids cry for like 2 hours before bed! In that case they basically had to go with the cry it out solution.

For me personally, at this stage in the game, this is the single most frustrating part of parenting, and I feel like a lot of parents would agree with me. 

Another thought is that it should really be a combination of people who put him to sleep. This is not always possible, but as often as possible, alternate putter-to-sleepers. And make sure you stay on the same page about techniques. If you're frustrated, I would recommend rather than handing the baby off, putting it down, getting a drink of water, splashing your face, then going back into the fray.

#### Naps

The baby will basically be sleeping every hour and a half or so. One thing I read, and this is my mantra with it, is that 'sleep begets sleep'. Overtiredness is very, very real. We had two major upgrades to Christian's schedule.

The first was that we moved his bedtime earlier in the night (7:30 is kind of a soft ceiling). At the time we just said no later than two hours after his last nap.

The second was to just put him down about an hour and a half after his last nap (this goes for bedtime as well). So when he gets up, we look at the clock. An hour and a half later is when we shoot to be putting him down. Note that this means kind of starting the pre-nap procedure like 10 minutes before.

Things REALLY smoothed out after this. And it's getting better.

#### A quick treatise on overtiredness

You know how cranky you get when you're tired? Well imagine you don't know how to sleep. And you're just constantly tired. That's the first step, you're just not having as much fun in life. This is stressful.

Falling asleep is a battle between melatonin, the sleep hormone, and cortisol, the stress hormone. Adults mainly get rid of cortisol by engaging in BDSM sexual activities and also shooting guns, activities otherwise inaccessible to babies (thanks Obama). Cortisol levels are brought down by calming activities (child-directed play, just letting them do whatever is a very calming activity) and by sleep itself. So right there, not enough sleep = high cortisol.

Melatonin is very fickle, but it also builds gradually, and makes you feel sleepy. However, if you do not go to sleep at the top of the wave, then your body goes into 'second wind' mode and, you guessed it, produces cortisol. 

So you can kind of see the intuition behind 'sleep begets sleep'. On one hand it allows you to balance the cortisol and melatonin levels. On the other, it allows the baby to practice falling asleep, to ride the wave of melatonin. 

#### Travel

It's kind of counterintuitive, but you can definitely travel now. In fact, this is probably going to be the best time to do that for 5 years or so

## Other shit that was helpful

### Books

[Penelope Leach: Your Baby and Child from Birth to Age 5](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Baby-Child-Birth-Five/dp/0375712038) Mom got me this and it's a really lovely introduction to raising and nurturing a baby and child. Good fundamentals.

[Amazing Minds](https://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Minds-Nurturing-Developing-Activities/dp/0425232247) This is an unbelievably good book and really goes through how a baby's brain develops. The author goes through the relevant research and does a very good job making it accessible. I will mail you my copy once I've gone back through it, no joke.

### Misc

If you are doing bottles of any kind, we got a bottle warmer.

As Veronica mentioned, you can't have too many burp cloths.

If you find a sleep-sack thing that works with you and your baby, get another one because it will get barfed on and you will need to wash it. 

We got a shitload of like waterproof padding things and basically put them underneath all the bedding/changing things. 

If you're going to do birth announcements, in any form, you might want to get as much done ahead of time. We got an announcement from one of Veronica's friends like 3 days after she gave birth, an astounding feat.

We manage baby pictures by keeping a central Google pictures repository, the link to which we hand out to people who might be interested. <- on this note, I read a lifehacker article that was like 'look your kid is going to make a bunch of art, keep 10% of it and make an instagram feed of the rest of it'.

Brush your kid's hair. Christian got cradle cap which was, at worst, just slightly gross.
